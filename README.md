# 🎩 Rust Borrowing and Ownership Practise Mini-project

Hi there 🤩!! I wanted to learn more about Ownership and borrowing in Rust 🦀. I crafted this (over a number of days 🫨) to reinforce the learning and force myself to understand it deeply
---

## 💡 What does this do;
Parses through Strings and returns selected words based on their identification e.g. if you wanted to find out the; 
- first word 
- second word
- nth word (learnt that this nth is actually an unspeccified term to refer to any index lol, had no idea about that before)
- longest word

---

## 🏅 This project demonstrates my understanding of;
- Ownership
- Borrowing
- mut references
- String slices (&str)
- Byte-level operations and how to convert String to bytes
- Writing functions that return references
- String parsing logic & syntax


## 📠 DEMO
Statement - "Rust is fast and memory safe"
- Print first word - "Rust"
- Print second word - "is"
- Print longest word - "memory"
print nth word -5th - "memory"

---

## All logic is implemented manually to practise low-level control using bytes and slices! This project helped me understand how Rust's 🦀 ownership theory comes into play!
